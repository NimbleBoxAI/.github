## 🏡 Know Our Team

Nimblebox first came as an idea to help our founders fix a problem they were all dealing with. Why was setting up an AI environment such a hassle on traditional cloud platforms?


Our team decided to take matters into their own hands, by building an online AI platform.


## 🎯 Mission and Values 
Make AI accessible to everyone by making the barrier to entry almost negligible. NimbleBox wants to democratise AI.

Imagine a world where K-12 students to experienced professionals are learning to code and trying to implement it in their daily workflow — that’s today. Now imagine a world where everyone is trying to learn and implement AI in their daily workflow — that’s the future we at NimbleBox envision.
